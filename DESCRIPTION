Title: Synthetic Microdata and Spatial MicroSimulation Modeling for ACS Data
Version: 0.2.5
Authors@R: person("Alex", "Whitworth",,email = "whitworth.alex@gmail.com", c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Builds synthetic microdatasets of American Community Survey (ACS) data
  (pulled via API) at any specified geographic level with 10 default individual
  attributes. Additionally, provides funtionality for users to add additional ACS
  & non-ACS synthetic data-attributes to micro-datasets based on macro population characteristics. In addition to creating synthetic data, synthACS also conducts
  spatial microsimulation modeling (SMSM) (ie- optimally fits synthetic microdata
  to macrodata constraints) via simulated annealing. SMSM is conducted in parallel
  by default.
