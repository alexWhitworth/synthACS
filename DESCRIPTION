Title: Synthetic Microdata and Spatial MicroSimulation Modeling for ACS Data
Version: 0.5.0
Authors@R: person("Alex", "Whitworth",,email = "whitworth.alex@gmail.com", c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Firstly provides a wrapper to library(acs) to access
  numerous American Community Survey (ACS) base tables which may be of interest
  to many researchers. Secondly, it builds synthetic micro-datasets of ACS data
  at any specified geographic level with 10 default individual attributes. Thirdly,
  the package provides functionality for users to add additional ACS & non-ACS  data attributes to micro-datasets based on macro population characteristics. And
  finally, the package also conducts spatial microsimulation modeling (SMSM)
  via simulated annealing.  SMSM is conducted in parallel by default.
