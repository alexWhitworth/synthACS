Title: Synthetic Microdata and Spatial MicroSimulation Modeling for ACS Data
Version: 1.5.1
Authors@R: person("Alex", "Whitworth", , email = "whitworth.alex@gmail.com", c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides access to curated American Community Survey (ACS) base tables via a wrapper
  to library(acs). Builds synthetic micro-datasets at any user-specified geographic level with
  ten default attributes; and, conducts spatial microsimulation modeling (SMSM) via simulated
  annealing.  SMSM is conducted in parallel by default. Lastly, we provide functionality for
  data-extensibility of micro-datasets.
